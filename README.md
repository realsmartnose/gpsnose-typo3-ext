# GpsNose for TYPO3

Welcome to the GpsNose TYPO3-extension package ;-)!

You can use the login, real geo-data and nearby anonymous communication from the GpsNose platform in your web-site.

## Key-points

- Your web-users can enter the web-community of your website (%www.YOURDOMAIN.com) or a sub-community (%www.YOURDOMAIN.com@fishing)
- Your otherwise virtual users are immediately real geo-enabled, can communicate in real-world and real-time also outside your web.
- The data your users generate are available at your website, such as users, PoIs, events, tracks..
